Howdy and welcome, I'm Drew!

Feel free to take a look around; when I'm gainfully employed I'm typically super heads-down in whatever I'm working on. Anything you see here during those times is likely a quick experiment for context on something going on at work. You can also see when I wasn't employed by sudden bursts of activity while trying to catch up on anything I could while I had some mental space and free time between interviews.

## Where else to find me

Some spaces where I maintain some presence:

* [BlinkingBoxes.net](https://blinkingboxes.net)
  * My most accurate profile, for better or worse. It's a mess and doesn't reflect what I'm capable of, just what I like throwing around. Like my favorite long-running s***post. Feel free to check it out and if it doesn't make you laugh somewhere, you probably read it wrong or took it too seriously.
* [devmem.sh](https://www.instagram.com/devmem.sh/)
  * currently just a tech-focused s***posting account. It clicked one day that I'm a linux nerd and developer in Memphis and with the explosion of TLDs, buying `devmem.sh` was too good to pass up. I'd like to expand that out as more of my long-term work alias and it's been really fun to think about that one and I have some ideas to push more there soon.
* [@drewc@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@drewc)
  * I do enjoy social media but Im torn on the current state of the world. Mastodon has my vote by a longshot.

## Exposition on Current and Recent Work

Over the years I've been getting more and more into build and deploy systems and observability at large. A lot of my efforts are focused on making change safe, easy, and cheap for engineers in technical organizations. **I believe that the key to quality and reliablity is allowing engineers to experiment and fail fast on systems that are as close to prod as possible.** Practically everything I do is about building that for myself and other engineers within an organization. I also really love observability systems because, when done correctly, it feels like having both a massive radio telescope and electron microscope to reason about global-scale systems with mind-boggling (well, my mind gets boggled often) complexity. Zooming out and in at-will to see big issues and dive in within seconds just makes me feel like a wizard. It's so cool. And flame graphs on top of well-built tracing is just *chef's kiss* for global-scale backends.

**Another thing I'd really like to do is get deeper into contributing to open source.** Open source presents lots of problems for organizations, but I've seen it work well when great engineers are given easy access to amazing software. I had a huge chance to get my feet wet in open source at Dropbox and didn't have the concepts at the time to really understand what a big opportunity I was overlooking. Since I know I have trouble balancing work, hobbies, and parenting, my best bet to contribute to open source is really to get into a company that participates in the open source community since I'm usually working on work outside of work and context-switching into hobbies that are just for play feels antithetical to what I'm really after here. I'm not convinced it's great to be such a workaholic and I've had a few managers work hard to coach me into more sustainable long-term approaches to work that won't burn me out so fast. I do my best and appreciate their guidance.

I failed miserably to land a single change at Dropbox, but I took what I learned and was able to knock out a few big things at FB before life took some turns there, too. Getting to take all of my experience and really push on it in a nearly-greenfield way to benefit an organziation like ALSAC where the mission fuels cancer research for the hospital has been one of the most amazing opportunities of them all. I'm willing to talk about this stuff any time and all the time.

## YAML Cowboys

Folks around me in devops and SRE mention often "I'm burned out from just writing yaml all day and I want to do something that feels real and technical."

I have no ability to relate to that sentiment. I love the Unix philosophy of tools that do simple things well and can be easily stitched together through simple, common interfaces. Let me push my will to millions of machines and running processes through a few lines of yaml and then I get to go engage with some of the best engineers in the world on the neat parts of these systems and their problems? Yes, please. I like to make my laziness scale such that it looks like I worked really hard but didn't.

I've also never worked at a company that couldn't use one single contribution to a custom module or collection under the hood of that yaml. Lift the hood, make the world better, land some impact. I've also found that some of the most self-serving projects I've ever worked on were the most long-lasting and impactful for not just me but other engineers. Those are my favorites.

## Shout Outs

I've worked with a ton of amazing folks, here are some that have made major impacts on how I think about work, life, and a bit of everything:

Note: *I want to put some people on this list but I'd rather do it through a set of PRs and ask folks to consent to their inclusion on this list and what I'm saying about them, so I intend for this to be populated over time.*
