# YAML Woes?

Folks around me in devops and SRE mention often "I'm burned out from just writing yaml all day and I want to do something that feels real and technical." I'd like to offer a response here to those folks.

I’ve heard that sentiment and I do understand it (I think it's more "I want to break free" than "I hate my job and YAML"), but for me YAML is just a compact interface to real systems and real impact. I love the Unix philosophy of tools that do simple things well and can be easily stitched together through reasonable, common interfaces. Let me push my will to millions of machines and running processes through a few lines of text and then I get to go engage with some of the best engineers in the world on the neat parts of these systems and their problems? Yes, please. I like to make my laziness scale such that it looks like I worked really hard but didn't.

I've also never worked at a company that couldn't use one single contribution to a custom module or collection under the hood of the markup. Lift the hood, make the world better, land some impact. I've also found that some of the most self-serving projects I've ever worked on were the most long-lasting and impactful for not just me but other engineers. Those are my favorites.
